# DTCC Atlas++ MVP

Standalone web app that projects EPSG:3006 (SWEREF99 TM) GeoJSONs onto a 3 m × 3 m 3D-printed Gothenburg city model via a calibrated overhead projector.

- **Design spec:** `../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-22-dtcc-atlaspp-mvp-design.md`
- **Plan:** `../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-22-dtcc-atlaspp-mvp.md`
- **Acceptance log:** `./acceptance-log.md`

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:projector # operator/projector path: chrome-free fullscreen Chrome window (macOS)
npm run dev          # Vite on 5175 plus control API on 5176 in a normal browser
npm run dev:vite     # Vite-only server on http://localhost:5175
npm run build        # static site in dist/
npm run preview      # serve the built dist/
npm test             # vitest unit tests
```

Deploy `dist/` under a **local HTTP server** (`caddy file-server`, `python -m http.server`, `npx vite preview`). `file://` is not supported.

## Projector display

On the Mac wired to the projector, launch the chrome-free view in one command:

```bash
./run-projector.sh    # from the repo root
# or, from this folder:
npm run dev:projector
```

This starts the dev servers and opens `http://localhost:5175/projector` in a
dedicated Chrome window in app mode (no address bar or tabs) at full screen, so
the whole projection surface is usable. Exit fullscreen with `Ctrl`+`Cmd`+`F`;
quit the window with `Cmd`+`Q`. Stopping the launcher (`Ctrl`+`C`) also closes
the projector window, so rerunning the command always gives a fresh one.

The projector window uses a dedicated Chrome profile (`~/.dtcc-atlaspp-projector`)
so its flags are honored even when Chrome is already running, and its saved
calibration persists across restarts. Calibrate once in this window; that
calibration is separate from your normal Chrome profile.

A calibration saved in this profile is not visible from the fallback path, which
uses your normal browser profile and keeps its own calibration.

Fallback (no Chrome, or non-macOS): run `npm run dev`, open
`http://localhost:5175/projector`, then enter fullscreen: macOS Chrome uses
`Ctrl`+`Cmd`+`F`; other browsers commonly use `F11`.

## Operator remote

The operator remote is a LAN-only browser page for a second device such as an iPad. The projector Mac remains the source of truth; the remote only posts discrete commands through the local control server.

Dev mode:

```bash
./run-projector.sh
```

This starts the projector and servers with the chrome-free launcher. Reference
projector URL, opened automatically by the launcher:

```text
http://localhost:5175/projector
```

Open the remote on the iPad using the Mac LAN IP:

```text
http://192.168.1.42:5175/remote
```

Production mode:

```bash
npm run build
ATLAS_REMOTE_PUBLIC_URL=http://192.168.1.42:5175/remote npm run control:serve
```

Use the Mac's actual LAN IP in `ATLAS_REMOTE_PUBLIC_URL`. If this variable is omitted, the server warns and falls back to `127.0.0.1`, which works on the Mac but not from an iPad.

Use the 3-digit PIN shown on the projector to pair the iPad. After server restart or projector reload, old remote tokens are invalidated and the iPad must pair again.

## Calibration flow

1. On the machine wired to the projector, launch the chrome-free view with `./run-projector.sh` (see [Projector display](#projector-display)). Fallback: open the app and enter fullscreen with `Ctrl`+`Cmd`+`F` in macOS Chrome or `F11` in other browsers.
2. On first run, the app opens directly in bbox-framing mode. Pan/zoom the map to match the geographic extent of the printed model. Press **Lock bbox**.
3. The test-pattern view appears. Drag the four orange corner handles onto the physical corners of the printed model. The yellow grid will warp live. Press **Save calibration**.
4. Drop an EPSG:3006 (SWEREF99 TM) `.geojson` file onto the control panel in the bottom-right. It renders onto the model. Use the color picker and basemap toggle to taste. Press **c** to re-run calibration.

## Network requirements

| Asset | When fetched | Offline behavior |
|---|---|---|
| App bundle | First load, cached | Served locally after |
| Montserrat (Google Fonts) | Every page load | Falls back to system sans-serif |
| OSM tiles for bbox framing | During `calibrate.bbox` | Calibration blocked without tiles |
| OSM tiles for view-mode basemap | Toggle on | Toggle on without network → grey tiles |
| User GeoJSON, calibration, settings | Never — localStorage | Always offline |

## Known limitations

- Single city per install; re-point by re-calibrating.
- EPSG:3006 (SWEREF99 TM) only — reproject upstream with `ogr2ogr -t_srs EPSG:3006 out.geojson in.shp`. WGS84 files are rejected with a reprojection hint.
- Calibration tied to window resolution at save time; a resize triggers a re-calibrate banner.
- OSM public tile server is used as-is; swap to a Stadia/MapTiler key if deploying.
